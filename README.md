## Key Objectives
1. Identify how room type, neighborhood, and other attributes influence pricing.
2. Conduct regression analysis to determine key price predictors.
3. Validate findings through hypothesis testing and statistical tools.

- **Neighborhood**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most expensive, while the Bronx and Staten Island are more budget-friendly.
- **Reviews**: Budget-friendly listings attract more frequent reviews, while luxury listings rely less on review volume.
- **Other Factors**: Availability and host portfolio size have minimal impact on pricing.
